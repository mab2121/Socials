The primary objective was to replicate essentialfeatures of Instagram, such as user profiles, image uploading,post feeds, and interactive elements like likes and comments.I. MOTIVATION“Socials” is not just another social media platform; it’s arevolution in how students interact online. Developed by agroup of NYU students who were frustrated by the limita-tions of existing social media in academic settings, ”Socials”provides a tailored environment where students can discussprojects, form study groups, and support each other’s academicand extracurricular pursuits—all within a network that under-stands the rhythm of student life.How can technology bring NYU students closer together?With this in mind, we developed a platform that not onlyallows students to connect socially but also serves as abridge between various academic departments and studentorganizations.Whether it’s showcasing creative work, exchanging ideas,or organizing campus events, ”Socials” is the go-to platformfor students to engage with their peers in a meaningful way.II. INTRODUCTIONIn the fast-paced realm of digital communication, socialmedia platforms serve as essential conduits for interaction,content sharing, and information dissemination. College stu-dents, a significant and active user demographic, utilize theseplatforms extensively for social connectivity and personalexpression. In response to their specific needs, our project,“Socials,” was conceived to reimagine an Instagram-like plat-form tailored for this audience, leveraging the comprehensivecapabilities of Amazon Web Services (AWS).The initial architectural strategy for ”Socials” involvedadopting a microservices architecture to allow for the flexibledevelopment, deployment, and scaling of independent services.However, as the project developed and the complexity ofmanaging multiple services at scale became more apparent,it necessitated a shift towards a more robust orchestrationsolution. This shift led to the adoption of Kubernetes (K8s), asophisticated container orchestration system that significantlyenhances the deployment, scaling, and operational manage-ment of application containers across host clusters. While thecurrent design still employs a microservices architecture, itis now underpinned by Kubernetes, unlike the earlier user-managed setup, providing a more structured and efficientmanagement of the microservices.This shift was motivated by the dynamic and high-volumeinteraction patterns of college students, who demand a plat-form that is not only functionally rich but also consistently reli-able and scalable. Kubernetes offers advanced features such asautomatic binpacking, self-healing, auto-scaling, and servicediscovery, which are crucial for maintaining the performanceand availability of Socials under varying loads.Utilizing AWS services such as Amazon EKS (Elastic Ku-bernetes Service) further empowered our team to seamlesslyintegrate Kubernetes, facilitating the management of clustersand simplifying containerized application deployment. Thisstrategic pivot to Kubernetes underscores our commitment toproviding a seamless, efficient user experience for collegestudents, ensuring that Socials can handle their intensive mediasharing and social interactions.This report will elaborate on the developmental journeyof Socials, from its initial microservices framework to itscurrent Kubernetes-based architecture. It will detail the ar-chitectural decisions, the integration of AWS services, andthe performance benefits realized, aiming to establish Socialsas a scalable, secure, and user-centric platform that resonatesstrongly with college students.III.
